This is a test for playing with Git
It is a repo for testing 
Think will do:
simple init
adding
modifying
diffs
some stuff here, at the same time as I was working on feature2
changes when on feature3 branch
changes to readme on master branch
changes when on feature4 branch
changes to readme on master (at the same time as feature4)
changes to readme on master (at the same time as feature5)
